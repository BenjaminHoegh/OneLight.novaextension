## Instructions

1. Go to **Extensions > Extensions Library > Themes (tab)** and pick the theme from there.

   If that doesn't work, just clone this project (or download it from the releases page), it'll magically turn into a 'component' thingy, and you can then double-click it to add this theme to Nova!

2. Go to **Nova > Preferences > Theme** and select the theme.
